# DrawDataWidget

## Introduction
DrawDataWidget is a Python library that enhances interactive learning and demonstration of machine learning algorithms via Jupyter widgets. This tool allows users to visually create datasets directly within their Jupyter notebooks, promoting an engaging learning experience. The widget supports any environment that runs ipywidgets, including Jupyter, VSCode, and Colab.

## Features
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Users can draw and categorize data points interactively.
- **Integration with Machine Learning**: Real-time updates to the dataset trigger retraining of machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, and Google Colab through `anywidget`.

## Install DrawDataWidget using pip:

**python -m pip install drawdatawidget
